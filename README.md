[TBWA\DAN Mapper](http://labs.tbwa.com.hk/danmapper/)
=================

Projection Mapping is a exciting projection technique that can turn almost any surface or object into a dynamic video display. DANMapper can mask and distort the projected image and make it fit perfectly on different perspectives. When done right, the end result is a dynamic projection installation that transcends ordinary video projection. 

All you need is a projector to get started. Launch DANMapper, browse for a video or SWF. For realtime data, you can import any SWF which loads external data, displays charts, physics engines, news feeds, games and more. DANMapper is built with a minimal interface and easy-to-use functions. You'll see a live preview on your screen, and context menus for fast editing. To hide the UI and make the projection live, simply double click.
